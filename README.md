# ToTTo Fine-tuning in colab
This repository serves as the hub for the ToTTo dataset, offering a collection of diverse T5-base models fine-tuned on the ToTTo dataset. 

This repository presents a comparative analysis of various T5-base models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess their performance on the controlled table-to-text generation task proposed by ToTTo.

In addition, for beginners to learn easily, all tasks come with Colab notebooks for seamless execution.
